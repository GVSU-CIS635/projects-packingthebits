# Code Setup

This project consists of a series of Python scripts (found in the `code` directory) that can either be run individually
or through the `main.py` entrypoint. The following dependencies are needed to run this project:

| Dependency | Version |
|:-----------|:-------:|
| Python     | 3.14    |
| Pandas     | 2.3.3   |
| Numpy      | 2.3.3   |

To simplify the process of retrieving the dependencies, an `environment.yml` file has been provided for use with `conda`
or similar package management systems (`mamba`, `pixi`, etc.). An example of setting up with `conda` is:

1. Install `conda` if not already installed. Directions can be found
[online](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
2. Download dependencies and create new environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate environment: `conda activate packing_the_bits`

Once the environment has been activated, you are ready to run the project.

# Project Directory Overview

- `code`: Contains code for running the project
- `documents`: Proposal, progress report, and final report as submitted on Blackboard.
- `data`: Contains example data for running the project. The data submitted within the report are protected data, and
cannot be shared at this time.

# Example Data

Example data can be downloaded from GitHub (INCLUDE LINK HERE ONCE GENERATED). It can also be created by the user via:

```
# Start from the top level project directory
cd data

# Download required file
wget https://github.com/huishenlab/biscuit/releases/download/v1.7.1.20250908/hg38_biscuit_qc_assets.zip
unzip hg38_biscuit_qc_assets.zip

# Run script to create example data
python create_data.py hg38/cpg.bed.gz
```

# Project Code Overview

## Running the Whole Pipeline

```
# Start from the top level project directory
cd code

# Run default pipeline
python main.py

# If you have your own data that conforms to the example data
